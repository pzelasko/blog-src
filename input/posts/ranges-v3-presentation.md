# Slides about range-v3

This post is going to be short. A few weeks ago I was giving a presentation at a local C++ User Group meetup about the Ranges TS (technical specification) which is most likely going to enter the C++20 standard. An existing implementation of the Ranges TS is the range-v3 library by Eric Niebler, which introduces some interesting new features beyond the STL algorithms, such as e.g. lazily evaluated range adaptors. [You can find the slides from my talk at slides.com](http://slides.com/piotrzelasko/range-v3-incoming-changes-in-the-stl#/). There is also the [source code for the examples on github](https://github.com/pzelasko/range-v3-snippets). 

Enjoy!
