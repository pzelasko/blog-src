Title: About Me
---
So, you clicked it - great, now I can boast! 

I'm a programmer and a scientist, passionate about machine learning, deep learning and voice technologies in particular. I work at [Techmo](http://techmo.pl/index.php?lang=en) developing Polish speech recognition and voice biometry systems, pursuing PhD in these topics at the same time. Before that, I've graduated at [AGH-UST](http://www.agh.edu.pl/en/) in Cracow with an M.Sc. Eng. in Acoustic Engineering.

You can find my scientific publications e.g. at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.pl/citations?user=5YUtDtEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
